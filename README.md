## Overview

The **Quiz App Backend** is a backend application for a quiz system built with Java and Spring Boot. It uses a microservices architecture to separate the business logic into two main services:

- **Question Service:** Manages quiz questions.
- **Quiz Service:** Manages quizzes, which include requesting quiz questions and scoring.

Additional components include service discovery with Eureka, inter-service communication using Feign clients, an API Gateway for routing, and persistent data management with Spring Data JPA and MySQL. The backend runs on an embedded Tomcat server.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**
- **Spring Boot**
- **Microservices Architecture**
- **Eureka Server (Service Discovery)**
- **Feign Client (Inter-service Communication)**
- **API Gateway**
- **Embedded Tomcat**
- **Spring Data JPA**
- **MySQL**
- **Postman** (for API testing)

## Architecture

The architecture is designed for scalability and maintainability. The key components include:

- **API Gateway:** Routes requests to the appropriate microservices.
- **Eureka Server:** Handles service discovery for dynamic microservice registration.
- **Question Service:** Exposes endpoints to create, update, retrieve, and delete quiz questions.
- **Quiz Service:** Manages quizzes, interacts with the Question Service via a Feign client, and handles quiz logic.

## Microservices

### 1. Question Service

- **Responsibilities:**  
  - Manage CRUD operations for quiz questions.
  - Provide endpoints for question creation, modification, deletion, and retrieval.

- **Key Components:**  
  - Spring Boot Application
  - JPA Repositories for data access
  - REST Controllers

### 2. Quiz Service

- **Responsibilities:**  
  - Manage quizzes, including quiz creation and question aggregation.
  - Communicate with the Question Service using a Feign client.

- **Key Components:**  
  - Spring Boot Application
  - JPA Repositories for data access
  - REST Controllers
  - Feign Client for inter-service communication

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Java 11** or later
- **Maven** (or your preferred build tool)
- **MySQL Server**
- **Git**

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/karthik6603/quiz-app-backend.git
   cd quiz-app-backend
   ```

2. **Build the Project:**

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

### Configuration

1. **Set Up the Database:**

   - Create a new MySQL database named `quiz_app_db`.
   - Configure your `application.properties` or `application.yml` file with the correct database credentials:

     ```properties
     spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/quiz_app_db
     spring.datasource.username=root
     spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
     spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
     spring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL8Dialect
     ```

## Running the Application

1. **Start MySQL Server.**
2. **Run the Application:**

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

3. **Access the APIs:**

   - API Gateway: `http://localhost:8080`
   - Eureka Server: `http://localhost:8761`
   - Question Service: `http://localhost:8081`
   - Quiz Service: `http://localhost:8082`

## Testing with Postman

1. Import the Postman collection (if available) to quickly test the APIs.
2. Manually test endpoints such as:
   - `POST /questions` - Add a new question.
   - `GET /questions` - Retrieve all questions.
   - `POST /quizzes` - Create a new quiz.
   - `GET /quizzes/{id}` - Get quiz details.
